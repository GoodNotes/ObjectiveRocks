### Breaking Changes

The built-in encoding/decoding of keys and values via the encoding options is completelty removed from this release. The API is completely `NSData`-based now.

- Removed built-it Key/Value `Encoders` and `Decoders`
	- The conversions of custom types to/from `NSData` is the responsibility of the caller
- Removed `EncodingOptions`
- Removed all methods depending on `EncodingOptions` and the built-in key/value `encoding` and all of the their variants:
	- `setObject:forKey:`
	- `deleteObjectForKey:`
	- `objectForKey:`
	- `mergeObject:forKey:`
	- `mergeOperation:forKey:`
- Refactored all `Iterator`, `Key Comparator` and `Merge Operator` methods accordingly
- Removed `NSNumber` Key-Comparators
- Rename method for setting up default read & write options from `setDefaultReadOptions:andWriteOptions:` to `setDefaultReadOptions:writeOptions:`
	- The custom Swift equivalent is `setDefault(readOptions:writeOptions:)`
